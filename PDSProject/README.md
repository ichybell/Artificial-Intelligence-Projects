# Unsupervised Learning Project 

The goal of this project was to advance my machine learning skills by applying them to a specific public dataset that I would perform the following operations on:
1. Formulate a hypothesis that would be tested later on
2. Perform "classic" data analysis steps (data cleaning, EDA,dependent variable selection, regression, feature selection, classficiation, etc.) to determine if the hypothesis is supported or refuted.
3. Write conclusion embedded inside the Jupyter file

The dataset used was from [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) and can be found at `StudentsPerformance.csv` while the main Jupyter file well-documented can be found at `pds.ipynb`
